## Notes

- Each task begins by reading CLAUDE.md
- Mark tasks as completed in this file immediately after completion
- Update overall progress percentage after each task
- For tasks with sub-agents, verify all dependencies are complete before launching
- All tests must pass before marking task complete
- Production-ready code required from day one
- No proxies, no FastAPI - direct API Gateway to Lambda integration
- Two AWS accounts: Frontend (563334150189), Backend (921212210452)
- SOC2 compliance required throughout
